This repository is for keeping all network related projects that I have done. Currently it has the following projects:
1. Cascade Proxy File Stream Proxy - The project provides implementation of a set of proxy servers on raw TCP sockets. A client is setup which can request for a file from a server. The server streams the file through N different proxies.
2. HTTP-proxy Server - The HTTP proxy server contains a simple HTTP proxy server. It supports caching, concurrent client connections.
